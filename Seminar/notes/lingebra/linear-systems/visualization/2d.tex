\subsection{Two-dimensional Linear Systems}
\label{ssec:two-dimensional-linear-systems}

We dedicate this section to the visualization of linear systems in two variables
and their solutions. As already established, a linear equation in two variables
represents a \hyperref[def:straight-line]{straight line}. A solution to a linear
system in two variables is a pair of real numbers (equivalently, a point in the
real plane) which lies on every straight line determined by the equations of the
system. Simply put, the solution of a linear system in two variables is the
\emph{intersection} of all objects described by its equations.

An `ideal' linear system in two variables contains two linear equations
describing distinct lines. One such system is
\[
 \begin{array}{r c r c r}
  2x & - & y & = & 1\\
  x & + & y & = & 2
 \end{array}
\]
with solution $(1,1)$ and whose visual depiction is provided in
\myref{figure}{fig:well-determined-system}.

 $\clr{(1,1)}$.}

An easily proven fact (which we shall eventually prove in greater generality)
that follows immediately from the geometric view reads that a linear system in
two variables with two \emph{distinct} linear equations always has a solution --
the intersection point of the corresponding lines.

A linear system in two variables can only be underdetermined should it feature
just one non-trivial linear equation (or, equivalently, many identical linear
equations).
