\section{Applications}
\label{sec:applications}

In this final section of \myref{chapter}{chap:linear-systems}, we focus on some
`real-world' applications of linear systems and, more generally, on methods of
solving linear systems using computers.

The software we shall employ toward this end styles
\href{https://www.sagemath.org/}{SageMath}. It's a free open-source mathematics
software capable of numeric and symbolic manipulation of objects from various
fields of mathematics, linear algebra included. It can be installed on most
operating systems following the

SageMath is essentially a terminal-based software and out of the box offers no
graphical user interface. Upon launch,
