\section{Angle Between Vectors}
\label{sec:angle-between-vectors}

Having defined the \hyperref[def:length-of-a-vector]{length of a vector}, we now
turn to its \emph{direction}. The direction of a vector in $n$-dimensional space
is determined by the angles it forms with the coordinate axes. In order to
describe the direction of a two-dimensional vector, we need specify the angle it
forms with at least one of the axes. We do this naturally when we navigate. For
instance, the sentence `Turn slightly right,' in fact carries two pieces of
information:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Regard the direction you are currently facing as the origin, the angle
  being $0^{ \circ }$.
 \item Turn clockwise by an angle which we might regard as `slight', say,
  $30^{ \circ }$.
\end{enumerate}
